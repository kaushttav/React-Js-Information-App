            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, 
            JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. 
            It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. 
            React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

                A Component is a baseclass and all React components are inherited from this baseclass
                Component.
                Component class is defined in the React library.

            <h3>
                Text:
                Text is a component which is already defined in a library called React Native.
                We import the component Text from React Native Library.
                When compared to HTML tags which start with lowercase letters, React native
                components start with uppercase.

                <h3>
                We can use the "Button" JSX tag to get a button component.
               Button Tag has a property called ‘title’ which 
               can be used to display text inside the button.
               Button has another property called ‘color’ defined on it. We can use it to set a different color
               to the button. We can also use Hexadecimal numbers.

                View Component : ‘View Component’ is simply an empty container - just like ‘div’ in HTML.
                It has a style property defined on it.
